    This script attempts to create a copy of the Microsoft 365 Defender preset policies

    Depending on your organization, preset security policies provide many of the protection features that are available 
    in Exchange Online Protection (EOP) and Microsoft Defender for Office 365.

        Preset security policies allow you to apply protection features to users based on our recommended settings. 
        Unlike custom policies that are infinitely configurable, virtually all of the settings in preset security policies 
        aren't configurable, and are based on our observations in the datacenters. The settings in preset security policies
        provide a balance between keeping harmful content away from users while avoiding unnecessary disruptions.

    The script give generate copy of all policies that are releate to Standard and Strict present policies

    The policy on clone the existing policy and does not take care of any future change make back Microsoft backend team.
    Admins are responsible to manually update the changes that microsoft makes to preset on the clonned security preset policies

    This is basically a custom policy but completely using the existing preset policies at the time of script creation

    The scritpt can address few things

        *   Help apply further customization to preset that cannot be done default
        *   If the present not yet enabled on the tenant, the custom preset policeis will be created setting at the creation of ths script
        *   There are some configurable and non configurable paramters below is the list some of the relevant or notables
        *   Unchangeable Paramters: 
                EnableSuspiciousSafetyTip:feature cannot be MODIFIED an this is by design, this means that the "Strict Preset 
                Policy" value for EnableSuspiciousSafetyTip is True but cannot be transferred to the "Custom Strict Preset Policy" 
                because it cannot be changed For more information:

                ZapEnabled: This paramter by default is set to TRUE for both standard and strict but this is not configurable for 
                the HostedContentFilterPolicy(Anti-spam inbound policy) becuause is basicallt inherided from MalwareFilterPolicy. 

        *   Configuratable Paramters
                Malware Policy
                InternalSenderAdminAddress / ExternalSenderAdminAddress / EnableExternalSenderAdminNotifications: This paramter
                can be configured but is not configure on the both strict and standard policy. If you want use use it, the you
